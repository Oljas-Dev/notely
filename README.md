# Notely keep your notes and plans in one place

This is the first project that I've made fully on my own. The result makes me happy so far. If you find any bugs or you have any suggestions, I would appreciate listening to them.

The project is made with the help of React-router-dom and ContextAPI. It uses LocalStorage so don't be afraid of loosing your notes even after reloading :)
